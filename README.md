## Understanding the social and environmental drivers of malaria – a current risk map for Ghana.
#Project proposal
Although there have been large efforts to map the malaria risk and its distribution spatially and temporally globally (Gething et al., 2011) they are built from a historical framework of spatio-temporal data, that creates less accurate estimates of the current situation of disease risk. Since the birth of Roll Back Malaria in 2000, surveillance of malaria has been increased giving rise to several large datasets such as the Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) and in Malaria Indicator Surveys (MIS). There are currently no published maps for Ghana’s current malaria situation even though in 2011, UNICEF in collaboration with the National Malaria Control Programme was able to implement a national Malaria Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), which includes high resolution data on key malaria indicators including prevalence and incidence(PMI, 2015).  A current risk map would help guide a more targetted approach to malaria control for the National Malaria Control Program and allow optimised resource allocations.

My aim is to combine different large-scale datasets in an innovative geospatial models to create improved risk maps with greater accuracy. The integration of databases allows for higher spatial resolution providing less uncertainty in prediction estimates. Currently the most recent large-scale datasets available are the Demographic Health Survey(Ghana Statistical Service & Ghana Demographic Health Survery, 2014) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey by UNICEF (“UNICEF: Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys: Available reports/datasets. [http://www.childinfo.org/mics{_}available.html],” n.d.).  However, given the difference in collection methods, these data will have to be carefully processed and weighted in order to reduce collection bias for further modelling purposes. Other datasets that would be required would be the extraction of spatial rasters that can be linked to survey clusters for the geospatial models. These would be sourced from open GIS sources such as worldclim, NASA, NOAA etc.
